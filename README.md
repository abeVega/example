# Home Automation
**Our group will be creating a light weight, affordable home automation system for domestic use. Essentially, users will be able to easily control multiple appliances from a single location.**


## Project Description:
Users will be able to control appliances such as their oven, lights, and air conditioner, and also be able to schedule the use of these features and others such as sprinklers. A security system will also notify users of unauthorized entry and of fire alarms. Webcam monitoring will be available so that users may monitor their home at any time as well. A time logging feature will also allow users to view a log of their home automation actions. All these features will be accessed through a GUI with a user system in place.

The requirements we have set are as followed:

- GUI
	All features accessed through panel or phone app.

- User system/verification
	User preferences with manual control/customizability.

- Security
	Webcam access, Lock control, Security and fire alarm notification, mail/guest detection

- Temperature control
	Air conditioning, auto bathroom ventilation control

- Scheduling
	Sprinkler, pet feeder, notifications

- Appliance control
	Lights, garage door, oven, washing, drying machine entertainment system
